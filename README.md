FINER-SQL introduces **dense, interpretable rewards** to train **small language models (≤3B)** for Text-to-SQL via **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**.  
Beyond from Format Reward and Execution Reward, it combines:
- **Memory Reward** — semantic alignment with verified reasoning traces  
- **Atomic Reward** — atomic operation-level SQL overlap for structural feedback

This helps solving the sparse reward issue of reinforcement learning in Text-to-SQL.

✅ Achieves 67.5% EX on BIRD when training only on BIRD train, and 85% EX on Spider using only a 3B model.  
⚡ Runs efficiently on a single 12-24 GB GPU.

**We are cleaning and updating the code for easy to use.**
